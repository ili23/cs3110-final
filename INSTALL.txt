The only requirements to play our implementation of Go Fish is to have OCaml installed. 
Please follow the instructions at this link, https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html,
to install OCaml if it is not already on your computer. 

Open up a terminal from our project, change working directory to this project 
and run [make play] to start the game. 
You will prompted with the number of players the game will have. Please only enter an integer.
