# Go Fish Card Game

## Description: 

This is a terminal based implementation of the card game Go-Fish for our final project in our Functional Programming class (CS 3110). Our four-player version 
is playable on a single device which should be passed around between players. Apart from developing the game, the main goal of this final project was to familiarize ourselves with tools and practices used in industry such as Git, unit testing, and the SDLC.
